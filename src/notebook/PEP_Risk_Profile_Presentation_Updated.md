## Slide 3: Total Risk Decomposition

### Risk Components Breakdown

```
Total Risk = Systematic Risk + Unsystematic Risk
```

#### Risk Metrics (Annualized)
| Component | Value | % of Total |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| **Total Volatility** | 14.70% | 100% |
| **Systematic Risk** | 7.56% | 51.44% |
| **Unsystematic Risk** | 12.56% | 85.45% |

#### Key Insights
- **Systematic Risk:** Market-driven, unavoidable - accounts for ~51% of risk
- **Unsystematic Risk:** Firm-specific, diversifiable - dominates at ~85%
- **Correlation with SPY:** 0.5144 (Moderate)

#### Diversification Benefit
- **85.45%** of risk can be reduced through diversification
- Remaining **51.44%** is market-driven and unavoidable
- High unsystematic risk component suggests strong diversification opportunity

## Slide 4: Performance Metrics

### Risk-Adjusted Returns Analysis

#### 1. Jensen's Alpha (Ex-Post Performance)
- **Monthly Alpha:** 0.001447 (0.14%)
- **Annualized Alpha:** 1.74%
- **Interpretation:** Outperformed market by 1.74% annually after adjusting for risk
- **Statistical Significance:** Not significant (p-value = 0.651) - alpha could be due to chance

#### 2. Sharpe Ratio (Total Risk Adjustment)
- **PEP Sharpe:** 0.5129
- **SPY Sharpe:** 0.9094
- **Comparison:** PEP underperforms per unit of total risk due to high unsystematic risk

#### 3. Treynor Ratio (Systematic Risk Adjustment)
- **PEP Treynor:** 14.53%
- **SPY Treynor:** 13.26%
- **Interpretation:** PEP delivers superior return per unit of systematic risk

## Slide 5: Advanced Risk Metrics

### Downside Risk & Drawdown Analysis

#### Information Ratio
- **Alpha:** 1.74%
- **Tracking Error:** 12.56%
- **Information Ratio:** 0.1383
- **Meaning:** Modest alpha generation per unit of active risk

#### Sortino Ratio
- **Downside Deviation:** 8.85%
- **Sortino Ratio:** 0.8514
- **Focus:** Better than Sharpe when considering only downside volatility
- **Interpretation:** PEP has limited downside compared to total volatility

#### Maximum Drawdown
- **Largest Peak-to-Trough Decline:** -26.74%
- **Date Occurred:** 2025-05-30
- **Recovery Considerations:** Important for risk management and stop-loss strategies

## Slide 6: Comparative Performance

### PEP vs SPY Benchmark Comparison

| Metric | PEP | SPY | Winner |
|--------|-----|-----|--------|
| **Annual Return** | 9.54% | 15.26% | SPY |
| **Total Volatility** | 14.70% | 14.58% | SPY |
| **Beta** | 0.519 | 1.000 | - |
| **Sharpe Ratio** | 0.513 | 0.909 | SPY |
| **Treynor Ratio** | 14.53% | 13.26% | PEP |
| **Max Drawdown** | -26.74% | - | - |
| **R-squared** | 0.265 | 1.000 | - |

#### Key Takeaways
- **Excess Return:** -5.72% vs market (underperformed over period)
- **Risk-Adjusted Performance:** Lower Sharpe but higher Treynor ratio
- **Volatility Profile:** Similar total volatility but lower systematic risk
- **Correlation:** Only 26.5% of PEP variance explained by market movements

## Slide 7: Investment Implications

### Practical Applications & Recommendations

#### For Portfolio Construction
✓ **Beta for hedging:** Use β = 0.52 for market exposure management
✓ **Defensive allocation:** Suitable for risk-averse or conservative portfolios
✓ **Risk budget:** Only ~51% of portfolio risk from PEP will be systematic

#### For Risk Management
✓ **Monitor beta stability:** Rolling β has remained stable (0.46-0.66 range)
✓ **Drawdown limits:** Historical max drawdown of -26.74% occurred recently
✓ **Correlation changes:** Moderate 0.51 correlation provides some diversification benefit

#### For Performance Evaluation
✓ **Alpha generation:** Positive 1.74% annually but not statistically significant
✓ **Risk-adjusted metrics:** Sharpe 0.51 vs SPY 0.91 - underperforms on total risk basis
✓ **Benchmark appropriateness:** R² = 0.26 indicates weak market fit - consider broader factors
✓ **Treynor advantage:** 14.53% vs 13.26% - superior return per unit of systematic risk

#### Value Assessment (Original Question: "Is PEP underpriced?")
- **Jensen's Alpha:** +1.74% suggests modest outperformance after risk adjustment
- **However:** Alpha is not statistically significant (p = 0.65)
- **Caveat:** PEP underperformed SPY by -5.72% in absolute terms over this period
- **Conclusion:** Not clearly underpriced - defensive characteristics may explain lower returns
